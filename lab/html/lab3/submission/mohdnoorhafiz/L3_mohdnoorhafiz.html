        LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
        mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>
    According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an
    indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at
    the agency's inception in 1947.
    </p>
    CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several
    historic events, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>*the Cold War</ul>
    <ul>*the civil-rights movement</ul>
    <ul>*the growth of the international drug trade</ul>
