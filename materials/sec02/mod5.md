## USE CASE DIAGRAM : INTERACTION MODEL

In software engineering, an interaction model is a design concept that describes the way that different components of a software system interact with each other. It provides a high-level view of the system's behavior and functionality, and it can be used to guide the development process and ensure that all components are working together effectively.

There are several types of interaction models that are commonly used in software engineering, including:

**Use case diagrams:** A use case diagram describes the various interactions between actors (such as users or other systems) and the software system. It shows the different actions that users can take, as well as the system's responses to those actions.

**Sequence diagrams:** A sequence diagram shows the interactions between different components of the software system over time. It can be used to model complex workflows or interactions between different modules or subsystems.

**State diagrams:** A state diagram describes the different states that a system can be in and the transitions between those states. It can be used to model the behavior of a single component or the system as a whole.

Overall, interaction models are a key tool in software engineering for understanding how different components of a system interact with each other, and for ensuring that the system is designed in a way that is efficient, effective, and user-friendly.
