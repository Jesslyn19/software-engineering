## Module 5: Requirements Analysis and Modeling








## USE CASE DIAGRAM : INTERACTION MODEL

**INTERACTION MODEL**

In software engineering, an interaction model is a design concept that describes the way that different components of a software system interact with each other. It provides a high-level view of the system's behavior and functionality, and it can be used to guide the development process and ensure that all components are working together effectively.

There are several types of interaction models that are commonly used in software engineering, including:

- **Use case diagrams:** A use case diagram describes the various interactions between actors (such as users or other systems) and the software system. It shows the different actions that users can take, as well as the system's responses to those actions.

- **Sequence diagrams:** A sequence diagram shows the interactions between different components of the software system over time. It can be used to model complex workflows or interactions between different modules or subsystems.

- **State diagrams:** A state diagram describes the different states that a system can be in and the transitions between those states. It can be used to model the behavior of a single component or the system as a whole.

Overall, interaction models are a key tool in software engineering for understanding how different components of a system interact with each other, and for ensuring that the system is designed in a way that is efficient, effective, and user-friendly.

Use case modeling is a type of interaction model that is commonly used in software engineering to describe the interactions between actors (such as users or other systems) and the software system. It is a visual representation of the system's functionality from the user's perspective, and it is often used to guide the development process and ensure that the system meets user requirements.

**USE MODELING**
  
  In use case modeling, a use case diagram is used to depict the different actions that users can take and the system's responses to those actions. The diagram includes several key components:

- **Actors:** These are the different types of users or systems that interact with the software system. Actors are typically represented by stick figures in the diagram.

- **Use cases:** These are the different actions that users can take when interacting with the system. Use cases are represented by ovals in the diagram.

- **Relationships:** These are the connections between actors and use cases, and they show how the different components of the system interact with each other. Relationships are represented by arrows in the diagram.

- For example, a use case diagram for a banking application might include actors such as customers, tellers, and managers, and use cases such as "withdraw money," "deposit money," and "transfer funds." The diagram would show how each actor interacts with the system to perform these different actions.

Use case modeling is a useful tool for software engineers because it allows them to design systems that are user-centered and that meet the needs of the people who will be using the system. By modeling the different interactions between users and the system, engineers can ensure that the system is intuitive and easy to use, and that it provides users with the functionality that they need.

**Stereotypes of UML**
  
In Unified Modeling Language (UML), stereotypes are a way of extending the basic modeling elements to provide additional information or semantics. Stereotypes can be used to define new modeling elements or modify existing ones, and they are identified by a name enclosed in guillemets (<< >>).

Stereotypes are a useful tool in UML modeling because they allow developers to extend the basic modeling elements and provide additional information or semantics. By using stereotypes, developers can create more detailed and accurate models that better reflect the complexity of the systems they are designing. However, it is important to use stereotypes judiciously and to ensure that they are properly understood by all stakeholders involved in the modeling process.
