## Module 8 : Software Verification, Validation and Testing

(Click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fFqVSa7WdQ2Uet0UdvbQcALUVcqme6gw) for the PDF file for this module)

## Test-Case Approach 1 : Requirements-Based Testing

### Requirement-Based Testing :

1. Identify the requirements of the system that need to be tested
2. Create test cases that cover each requirement
3. Verify that each requirement is met by the corresponding test case
4. Ensure that all test cases are traceable back to the requirements they cover

#### Example:
Requirement: The login page should authenticate a user's credentials before granting access to the system
Test Case: Enter valid username and password and verify that access is granted to the system.

## Test-Case Approach 2 : Black-box Testing

### Black-box Testing :

1. Identify the input and output parameters of the system
2. Create test cases that cover different combinations of inputs and expected outputs
3. Execute the test cases and verify the actual output against the expected output
4. Ensure that all possible scenarios are covered, including boundary cases and invalid inputs

#### Example:
Input Parameter: A calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Test Case: Enter two positive integers and perform addition. Verify that the result is correct.

### Black-box Testing Strategies :

The two common black-box testing strategies are:

<b> Equivalence Partitioning </b> : This strategy involves dividing the input data into different partitions or classes based on the behavior of the system. Each partition represents a group of input values that are expected to behave similarly and produce the same output. Test cases are then designed to cover at least one input value from each partition. This helps in reducing the number of test cases required to cover all possible inputs.

<b> Boundary Value Analysis </b> : This strategy involves testing the system using input values that are at the extreme boundaries of the input domain. These extreme values are the minimum and maximum values of the input range, as well as the values immediately outside the input range. The purpose of this strategy is to identify any issues or errors that may occur at the boundaries of the input domain. By testing the boundary values, testers can ensure that the system behaves correctly and consistently across the entire input range.

## Test-Case Approach 3 : White-box Testing

### White-box Testing :

1. Understand the internal workings of the system, including its code and data structures
2. Create test cases that cover different branches, loops, and statements within the code
3. Use code coverage tools to ensure that all parts of the code are exercised
4. Verify that the system behaves correctly under different conditions, such as error handling and edge cases

#### Example:
Internal Function: A function that checks if a given number is prime
Test Case: Pass a prime number as input and verify that the function returns true. Pass a composite number as input and verify that the function returns false.
