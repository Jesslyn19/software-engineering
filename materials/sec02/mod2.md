   1.1 [Plan-driven & Agile process](#plan-driven-process-vs-agile-process)

2. [**Software process models**](#what-is-a-software-process-model)

   2.1 [Waterfall model](#waterfall-model)

   2.2 [Incremental model](#incremental-model)
   
   2.3 [Spiral model: coping with change](#spiral-model)

   2.4 [Reuse-oriented model](#reuse-oriented-model)

   2.5 [The Rational Unified Process (RUP)](#the-rational-unified-process-rup)

## What is software process‚ùì

Software processes are the **activities for designing, implementing, and testing a software system.**

## Software development lifecycle (SDLC)

A step-by-step process bringing a product‚Äôs concept from the ideation stage to implementation and eventually to the market.

## Plan-driven process VS Agile process

   |     Plan-driven process      |            Agile process            |
   | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
   |      Is always planned       |      Can accommodate  changes       |
   |    For stable development    |       For dynamic development       |
   | Rely on standardized process | Rely on people and their creativity |
   |  Suitable for large systems  |     Suitable for small systems      |
   |     eg. Waterfall Model      |           eg. Scrum Model           |

 <u>*It is best to include both approaches in practical processes.*</u>

## What is a software process model‚ùì

A software process model describes the **sequence** in which the phases of the software lifecycle will be performed.

## Waterfall Model 
- The **first** model to be introduced <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/23/11/d8231172c129ef4e296f212d9aa1efa4.gif" alt="Pin on Aniamtion Gif" width="17" />
- A linear and **sequential** approach to [SDLC](#software-development-lifecycle-sdlc)
- Each phase is carried out **completely** before proceeding to the next phase.

## Incremental Model
- Known as **multi-waterfall cycle**
- Each increment passes through the requirements, design, coding and testing phases.
- Functionality developed in each stage will be **added** on the previously developed functionality and this repeats until the software is **fully developed**.

## Spiral Model   
- A **risk-driven** model [(refer here)](https://www.google.com/search?q=risk-driven+model&source=lmns&bih=745&biw=1536&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv_rOx9__9AhXw1HMBHUAcCZwQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA)
- Each loop of the spiral is called a **phase of the software development process**
- The exact number of loops **varies** from project to project.<img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BoringShadyBluemorphobutterfly-max-1mb.gif" width="20" />
- During each iteration, the system is explored at **greater depth** and more details are added.

## Comparison of Various Models

| Properties                 | Waterfall Model | Incremental Model | Spiral Model |
| :------------------------- | :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------: |
| Planning early             |        ‚úì        |         ‚úì         |      ‚úì       |
| Returning to earlier phase |                 |         ‚úì         |      ‚úì       |
| Large project              |                 |                  |      ‚úì       |
| Low cost                   |        ‚úì        |         ‚úì         |              |
| Flexibility to change      |                 |         ‚úì         |      ‚úì       |
| User involvement           |       Low       |   Intermediate    |     High     |
| Risk involvement           |      High       |        Low        |    Medium    |
| Time-frame                 |    Very long    |       Long        |     Long     |

## Reuse-oriented Model
-  Based on the **existence** of a significant number of **reusable components**
-  Focuses on **integrating** these components into a system
