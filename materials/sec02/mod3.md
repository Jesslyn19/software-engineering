Agile development is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. 
It is a subset of the Agile methodology and is characterized by short development cycles, frequent releases, and a focus on delivering value 
to customers quickly.
Agile development is based on the Agile Manifesto, which values individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Agile development teams work closely with customers and stakeholders to understand their needs and provide frequent 
opportunities for feedback. 
The development process is typically broken down into small, manageable pieces, and work is organized into short iterations or sprints.
Some common practices used in Agile development include daily stand-up meetings, regular sprint planning and review meetings, continuous integration and testing, and user stories to capture requirements. 
Agile development also emphasizes teamwork, communication, and collaboration, with a focus on empowering individuals and allowing them to self-organize to get 
work done.

Overall, Agile development provides a flexible and adaptable approach to software 
development that can help teams deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently while 
responding to changing requirements and customer needs.

## Plan-Driven and Agile Development

![Plan-driven-and-Agile-RE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/228466110-aaab7c4a-d120-4950-8ecc-5e8a889921ee.png)

Plan-driven development and Agile development are two different approaches to software 
development, with different philosophies and methodologies.
Plan-driven development is a traditional approach to software development that emphasizes 
planning and control. In this approach, a detailed plan is developed at the beginning of the 
project, and work proceeds according to that plan. The plan is used to define the scope of the 
project, the milestones to be achieved, and the resources required to complete the project. 
The plan is typically created by a project manager or a team of experts, and it is updated 
periodically as the project progresses.

Agile development, on the other hand, is an iterative and collaborative approach to software 
development that emphasizes flexibility and adaptability. In this approach, the project is broken 
down into small, manageable pieces, and work is organized into short iterations or sprints. 
The focus is on delivering value to the customer quickly and frequently, with a high degree of 
collaboration between team members and customers.
In plan-driven development, the emphasis is on following a detailed plan and adhering to a 
strict schedule. 
In Agile development, the emphasis is on adapting to changing requirements and feedback from customers, with a focus on delivering working software quickly and efficiently.

Overall, plan-driven development and Agile development represent two different approaches to software development, with different strengths and weaknesses. Plan-driven development is often used in large, complex projects where detailed planning and control are necessary, while Agile development is often used in smaller, more dynamic projects where flexibility and adaptability are critical.


## Balance of Plan-Driven or Agile Development

![ju](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/228469060-1ed46e53-eb51-4716-be89-853d7ebdce91.jpg)

The balance of plan-driven and Agile development depends on the nature of the project and 
the needs of the stakeholders. Both plan-driven and Agile development have their strengths 
and weaknesses, and choosing the right approach requires careful consideration of the 
project's requirements, goals, and constraints.

In some cases, a plan-driven approach may be more appropriate, such as when the project has 
a clear and well-defined scope, a fixed budget, and a strict timeline. Plan-driven approaches 
may also be more suitable for projects that require a high degree of predictability and control, 
such as safety-critical systems or complex infrastructure projects.
In other cases, an Agile approach may be more appropriate, such as when the project 
requirements are unclear or subject to change, or when the project involves significant 
innovation or experimentation. Agile approaches may also be more suitable for projects that 
require a high degree of collaboration and communication among team members and 
stakeholders.

In practice, many software development projects use a hybrid approach that combines 
elements of both plan-driven and Agile development. For example, a project may begin with a 
detailed plan but use Agile methods for implementation, testing, and delivery. Alternatively, a 
project may use Agile methods for requirements gathering and design but then switch to a 
plan-driven approach for implementation and testing.

Ultimately, the balance of plan-driven and Agile development will depend on the specific needs 
of the project and the stakeholders involved. It is important to carefully consider the trade-offs 
and benefits of each approach and choose the approach that is best suited to achieving the 
project's goals. 

## Comparison between Plan-Driven and Agile Development:

## Agile Manifesto

![1556449377314](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/228457967-834ce7d1-5dc9-447e-bb8c-03a828d51bdf.png)

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development. It 
was created by a group of software developers in 2001 as a response to the limitations of 
traditional, plan-driven development methods.
The manifesto consists of four values and twelve principles that prioritize customer 
collaboration, working software, and flexibility over rigid plans and processes. The four values 
of the Agile Manifesto are:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

These values emphasize the importance of collaboration, communication, and adaptability in 
software development. They prioritize delivering value to the customer quickly and efficiently, 
and encourage a focus on working software over extensive documentation or planning.

The twelve principles of the Agile Manifesto expand upon these values, outlining specific 
guidelines for Agile development. These principles include: welcoming changing requirements, 
delivering working software frequently, building projects around motivated individuals, face-to-face communication, sustainable development, continuous attention to technical excellence and good design, simplicity, self-organizing teams, regular reflections and adaptations, and 
responding to change quickly.

Overall, the Agile Manifesto represents a shift away from traditional, plan-driven development 
methods and towards a more collaborative and adaptable approach to software development. 
It has had a significant impact on the software development industry, influencing the 
development of Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming. 

## The Principles of Agile Methods

supportive and trustful team environment, where team members are empowered to
make decisions and work together to achieve common goals.
6. Enable face-to-face interactions: Agile development encourages face-to-face 
interactions between team members, including business stakeholders, developers, and 
testers, to facilitate communication and collaboration.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress: Agile development prioritizes 
delivering working software as the primary measure of progress, rather than relying on 
metrics such as lines of code or hours worked.
8. Sustainable development: Agile development prioritizes sustainable development 
practices, including a focus on technical excellence, continuous improvement, and 
regular feedback.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design: Agile development 
emphasizes the importance of technical excellence and good design, including practices 
such as automated testing, refactoring, and continuous integration.
10. Simplicity: Agile development encourages teams to keep things simple and avoid 
unnecessary complexity, both in the software they develop and in their development 
processes.
11. Self-organizing teams: Agile development encourages self-organizing teams, where 
team members are empowered to make decisions and work collaboratively towards 
common goals.
12. Regular reflections and adaptations to improve efficiency: Agile development 
emphasizes regular reflection and adaptation to improve efficiency, including practices 
such as retrospectives and continuous improvement cycles.

Overall, the Principles of Agile Methods provide a framework for implementing Agile 
development in practice, and emphasize the importance of collaboration, flexibility, and 
continuous improvement in software development.

## Agile Methods Applicability

![2-Figure1-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/228471661-4985e730-1f23-441e-a52c-953bcae46be5.png)

Agile methods are applicable in a wide variety of software development contexts, including:
1. Rapidly changing environments: Agile methods are well-suited to environments where 
requirements are likely to change frequently, as they are designed to be flexible and 
adaptable.
2. Complex projects: Agile methods can be effective in complex projects where traditional 
plan-driven approaches may struggle to cope with uncertainty and changing 
requirements.
3. Small teams: Agile methods are particularly effective for small teams that require a high 
degree of collaboration and communication to deliver value to the customer.

contexts, where small changes or enhancements need to be made frequently to existing 
software.

Overall, Agile methods are most applicable in contexts where flexibility, collaboration, and 
customer focus are key priorities, and where traditional plan-driven approaches may struggle to 
cope with uncertainty and change. However, it is important to note that not all software 
development contexts are well-suited to Agile methods, and it is important to carefully consider 
the requirements of each project when selecting a development approach.

## Agile Development Techniques

![testing_techniques_of_agile_methodology_agile_development_methodology_slide01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/228490250-cf332692-8050-4262-b5a7-d2b050d993b7.jpg)

Agile development is an approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid iteration. 
Extreme Programming (**XP**), **DSDM**, **FDD**, **RUP**, **Kanban**, **Crystal**, and **Scrum** are all software development methodologies with different approaches and techniques.
1. **XP** (Extreme Programming)is an Agile software development methodology that focuses on rapid feedback, continuous testing and integration, and customer involvement to produce high-quality software efficiently.
2. **DSDM** (Dynamic Systems Development Method) is an Agile software development methodology that emphasizes frequent delivery of working software, active user involvement, and prioritization of requirements based on business value to ensure that the final product meets the customer's needs.
3. **FDD** (Feature-Driven Development) is an Agile software development methodology that focuses on creating and delivering high-quality software features in a timely and efficient manner.
4. **RUP** (Rational Unified Process) is a comprehensive software development process framework that emphasizes iterative development, risk management, and architecture-centric approach.
5. **Kanban** is a visual system for managing workflow. Kanban boards display the status of work items, and the team limits the amount of work in progress to improve efficiency.
6. **Crystal** is a family of Agile software development methodologies that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and simplicity, with a focus on tailoring the process to the needs of the project based on its size, criticality, and priorities.
7.  **Scrum** is a framework for managing and completing complex projects. Scrum emphasizes self-organizing teams and a flexible, iterative approach to development.

### XP(Extreme Programming)

![kanban-zone-agile-umbrella-287x300](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/228492351-8762434b-8c1f-4ec2-a2b4-fa009788428c.png)

A very influential agile method, developed in the late 1990s, that introduced a range of agile development techniques. 
Extreme Programming (XP) also takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development:
o New versions may be built several times per day
-To ensure that the code is always working and can be delivered quickly. This practice is known as continuous integration. Continuous integration is important in XP because it helps to catch errors early and ensures that the code is always in a releasable state. By integrating code changes frequently, XP teams can detect and fix errors quickly, reducing the risk of costly delays and rework later in the development process.

o Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks
-This is part of the practice known as "iterative and incremental development". Iterative and incremental development in XP involves breaking down the development process into small, manageable iterations or sprints. Each iteration is focused on delivering a working increment of the software that can be demonstrated to stakeholders and customers for feedback.
By delivering increments of working software every 2 weeks, XP teams can ensure that they are building the right product for the customer and that the software meets their needs. This frequent feedback helps to reduce the risk of building software that doesn't meet the customer's expectations or requirements, which can result in costly rework later in the development process.

o All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully
-This practice is known as "test-driven development" or TDD.
TDD in XP involves writing tests for a specific piece of functionality before writing the code to implement it. The tests are run frequently and automatically as part of the build process to ensure that the code works as expected and meets the requirements.
The goal of XP is to produce software that meets the needs of the customer while maximizing the value of the development effort. It emphasizes close collaboration between the development team and the customer to ensure that the software meets the customer's needs and is delivered on time and within budget.
