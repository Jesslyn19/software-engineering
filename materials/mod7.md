## Understanding the Relationship Between Analysis, Design, and Implementation 💡

- Software design is a creative activity. 🎨
- The stages of "software design and implementation" are:
    - The process of developing an executable software system. 🏗️
- Implementation is:
    - The process of executing the program design. ⚙️

## Object-Oriented Design Process 📏

- Involves developing several system models. 📐
- Requires a significant effort in terms of development and maintenance. 🧰
- Design models are important communication mechanisms. 🗣️

## Understanding Object-Oriented Design Principles 🚩

- Well-formed class:
    - Complete: Has all necessary components (data and methods) ✅
    - Sufficient: Has only necessary components (no excess) ✅
    - Cohesive: Related components that work together ✨
