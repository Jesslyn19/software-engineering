2. **Software process models**

   2.1 Waterfall model

   2.2 Incremental model

   2.3 Reuse-oriented model

   #### What is software process‚ùì

   Software processes are the activities for designing, implementing, and testing a software system.

   **Software development lifecycle (SDLC)** is a step-by-step process bringing a product‚Äôs concept from the ideation stage to implementation and eventually to the market.

   #### Plan-driven process üÜö Agile process

   |     Plan-driven process      |            Agile process            |
   | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
   |      Is always planned       |      Can accommodate  changes       |
   |    For stable development    |       For dynamic development       |
   | Rely on standardized process | Rely on people and their creativity |

‚Äã                                      <u>*It is best to include both approaches in practical processes.*</u>

#### What is a software process model‚ùì

A software process model describes the sequence in which the phases of the software lifecycle will be performed.

#### Waterfall Model <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/23/11/d8231172c129ef4e296f212d9aa1efa4.gif" alt="Pin on Aniamtion Gif" style="zoom:3%;" />

Each phase is carried out completely before proceeding to the next phase.

#### Incremental Model

 Each increment passes through the requirements, design, coding and testing phases.

#### Spiral Model   <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BoringShadyBluemorphobutterfly-max-1mb.gif" alt="Top Circle A Stickers for Android & iOS | Gfycat" style="zoom:10%;" />

A combination of iterative model and waterfall model. During each iteration, the system is explored at greater depth and more detail is added. ![Basic knowledge of Spiral Model In Software Engineering](https://biplus.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/spiral-mode.png)
