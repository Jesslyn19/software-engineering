   ### What is software process‚ùì

   Software processes are the activities for designing, implementing, and testing a software system.

   **Software development lifecycle (SDLC)** is a step-by-step process bringing a product‚Äôs concept from the ideation stage to implementation and eventually to the market.

   ### Plan-driven process üÜö Agile process

   |     Plan-driven process      |            Agile process            |
   | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
   |      Is always planned       |      Can accommodate  changes       |
   |    For stable development    |       For dynamic development       |
   | Rely on standardized process | Rely on people and their creativity |

<u>*It is best to include both approaches in practical processes.*</u>

### What is a software process model‚ùì

A software process model describes the **sequence** in which the phases of the software lifecycle will be performed.

### Waterfall Model 
Each phase is carried out completely before proceeding to the next phase. <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/23/11/d8231172c129ef4e296f212d9aa1efa4.gif" alt="Pin on Aniamtion Gif" width="15" />

### Incremental Model

 Each increment passes through the requirements, design, coding and testing phases.

### Spiral Model   

During each iteration, the system is explored at greater depth and more details are added.<img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BoringShadyBluemorphobutterfly-max-1mb.gif" width="20" />
